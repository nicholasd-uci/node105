## About

```
    In this repository we focus on 3 main types of Constructors. We give example of what a Constructor is and three examples of how the Original Build for Constructors are made. We then move onto a Factory Function Constructor as well as Class Constructors. This helps use with big data or application that will consist of lots of information.
