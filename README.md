## About

```
In this repository we focus on 3 main types of Constructors. 
We give example of what a Constructor is and three examples.
    - Original Build for Constructors 
    - Factory Function Constructor 
    - Class Constructors. 
This helps use with big data or application that will consist of a large amount of information.
